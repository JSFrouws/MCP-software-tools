# Terminal MCP Server Fixes

## Completed Solution - April 2025

The Terminal MCP Server has been completely rewritten with a cleaner, more reliable implementation that addresses all the original issues.

### Files Updated
- `terminal_server.py` - A streamlined implementation of the terminal server with the fixes applied
- `install_in_claude.py` - Script to install the server in Claude Desktop

### How to Use the Simplified Server

1. Install the terminal server in Claude Desktop:
```
python install_in_claude.py
```

2. Restart Claude Desktop

3. The simplified server will be available and ready to use

## Issues Fixed in the Simplified Version

### 1. Working Directory Tracking
The simplified version correctly tracks the working directory by:
- Properly updating `terminal_state["cwd"]` after directory changes
- Consistently using `terminal_state["cwd"]` in all output
- Using a simpler approach to directory change detection

### 2. Exit Code Handling
The exit code extraction is more reliable with:
- Clear marker pattern using `###EXIT_START###` and `###EXIT_END###` tags
- Regex-based extraction of exit codes
- Fallback to the process's return code when needed

### 3. Marker Output
Marker text is completely removed from the output by:
- Using distinct marker patterns that can be easily identified
- Using regex to remove all marker-related text from the output
- Separating command execution from output formatting

## Advantages of the Simplified Version

1. **Cleaner Code**: The simplified version has a more straightforward implementation without complex nested code.

2. **Improved Reliability**: By using a direct process execution model rather than maintaining a persistent shell process, we avoid many potential issues.

3. **Better Error Handling**: The simplified version has more robust error handling and logging.

4. **Easier to Maintain**: The code is more modular and easier to understand, making future maintenance simpler.

## Verification

The simplified server can be tested by:

1. Changing directories with `cd` commands and verifying the working directory is correctly reported

2. Running successful commands and confirming they report exit code 0

3. Running failing commands and confirming they report non-zero exit codes

4. Checking that no marker text appears in command output

## Next Steps

Consider these potential improvements to the simplified server:

1. Add support for more shell features (like PowerShell switching on Windows)

2. Implement session persistence across server restarts

3. Add more tools for file manipulation and system management

4. Enhance the output formatting for better readability
